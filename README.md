Skeletonize3D
=============

Skeletonize3D is a Fiji and ImageJ plugin that performs the skeletonization of 2D and 3D binary images (8-bit images). In Fiji, you can find it under **Plugins > Skeleton > Skeletonize (2D/3D)**. If you need to analyze a 2D/3D skeleton image, you may be interested on having a look at [AnalyzeSkeleton](http://fiji.sc/AnalyzeSkeleton).
